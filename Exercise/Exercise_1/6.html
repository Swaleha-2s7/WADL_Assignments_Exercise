        Mathematical logic is the foundation on which the proofs and arguments rest.
        Propositions are statements used in mathematical logic, which are either true
        or false but not both and we can definitely say whether a proposition is true
        or false.</p>
    <p>
        In this chapter we introduce propositions and logical connectives. Normal
        forms for well-formed formulas are given. Predicates are introduced. Finally,
        we discuss the rules of inference for propositional calculus and predicate calculus
