            Among the consequences of this profound result was the development of ideas
    concerning theoretical models of computers that eventually would help lead to
    the construction of actual computers.
    The theories of computability and complexity are closely related. In complexity theory, the objective is to classify problems as easy ones and hard ones;
    whereas in computability theory, the classification of problems is by those that
    are solvable and those that are not. Computability theory introduces several of
    the concepts used in complexity theory
