        &nbsp; A predicate formula is valid if for all possible assignments
        of values from any universe of discourse to free variables, the resulting
        propositions have the truth value T. Sometimes when we wish to derive some-conclusion from a given set of
        premises involving quantifiers. we may have to eliminate the quantifiers
        before applying the rules of inference for proposition formulas. Also, when
        the conclusion involves quantifiers, we may have to introduce quantifiers. The
        necessary rules of inference for addition and deletion of quantifiers
