        <p>Computer problems come in different varieties; some are easy, and some are
            hard. For example, the sorting problem is an easy one. Say that you need to
            arrange a list of numbers in ascending order. Even a small computer can sort
            a million numbers rather quickly. Compare that to a scheduling problem. Say
            that you must find a schedule of classes for the entire university to satisfy some
            reasonable constraints, such as that no two classes take place in the same room
            at the same time. The scheduling problem seems to be much harder than the
            sorting problem. If you have just a thousand classes, finding the best schedule
            may require centuries, even with a supercomputer</p>
