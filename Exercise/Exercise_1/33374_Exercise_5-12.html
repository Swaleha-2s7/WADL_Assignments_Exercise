        Mathematical logic is the foundation on which the proofs and arguments rest.
        Propositions are statements used in mathematical logic, which are either true
        or false but not both and we can definitely say whether a proposition is true
        or false.</p>
    <p>
        In this chapter we introduce propositions and logical connectives. Normal
        forms for well-formed formulas are given. Predicates are introduced. Finally,
        we discuss the rules of inference for propositional calculus and predicate calculus

        &nbsp;A predicate formula is valid if for all possible assignments
        of values from any universe of discourse to free variables, the resulting
        propositions have the truth value T.Sometimes when we wish to derive some-conlusion from a given set of
        premises involving quantifiers. we may have to eliminate the quantifiers
        before applying the rules of inference for proposition formulas. Also, when
        the conclusion involves quantifiers, we may have to introduce quantifiers. The
        necessary rules of inference for addition and deletion of quantifiers

    <h1>Complexity Theory</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Computer problems come in different varieties; some are easy, and some are
        hard. For example, the sorting problem is an easy one. Say that you need to
        arrange a list of numbers in ascending order. Even a small computer can sort
        a million numbers rather quickly. Compare that to a scheduling problem. Say
        that you must find a schedule of classes for the entire university to satisfy some
        reasonable constraints, such as that no two classes take place in the same room
        at the same time. The scheduling problem seems to be much harder than the
        sorting problem. If you have just a thousand classes, finding the best schedule
        may require centuries, even with a supercomputer</p>

        Among the consequences of this profound result was the development of ideas
concerning theoretical models of computers that eventually would help lead to
the construction of actual computers.
The theories of computability and complexity are closely related. In complexity theory, the objective is to classify problems as easy ones and hard ones;
whereas in computability theory, the classification of problems is by those that
are solvable and those that are not. Computability theory introduces several of
the concepts used in complexity theory
